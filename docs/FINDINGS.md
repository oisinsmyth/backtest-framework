# Findings

**What this programme has established that outlives any individual study.**

Unlike [decisions](decisions/README.md), which record one call each, and
[RULES.md](RULES.md), which binds future conduct, this file holds the **substantive
results** — the things we now know about markets, instruments and this book, with the
measurement that established each.

**Every claim here names the study that produced it.** A claim without one does not belong.

## 1. The arithmetic of a short position

**`gross = exposure x edge − short-leg convexity`**

Both terms have been measured, and together they explain every short failure in this
programme.

### 1a. `exposure x edge` is invariant to selectivity

**Tightening a threshold raises the conditional edge and shrinks the population it is
measured on, in exact opposition.** [D250](decisions/D250-the-overnight-gap-pre-screen.md)
measured it directly — as the cut moved from `z <= -1.5` to `z <= -3.0` the held-bar edge
tripled from −0.56% to −37.52% and the gross return **did not move**, pinned at ~0.4%/yr:

| cut | % of cells | held-bar edge | **gross** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| z ≤ −1.5 | 6.72% | +0.56% | −0.04% |
| z ≤ −2.0 | 3.51% | −11.53% | **+0.39%** |
| z ≤ −2.5 | 1.88% | −21.99% | **+0.40%** |
| z ≤ −3.0 | 1.07% | −37.52% | **+0.39%** |

**Selectivity cannot create gross return.** It redistributes the same return into fewer,
larger trades — which helps costs and nothing else.

**Corollary, and it is a rule for screening:** a screening target must be stated as the
**product**, never as the edge alone. D250 set a target of "−15%/yr held-bar edge"; the tail
cleared it at −37.52% and was still worth +0.29%/yr, because the cut that produced it holds
1.07% of cells.

**Independently confirmed three more times the same day**, on unrelated candidates: short VXX
(edge ~47 points over borrow, capped at **+2.35%/yr** by a 90% maintenance margin),
specialised-ETF underperformance (−3%/yr but possibly 0–5 qualifying names → **0.1–0.45%/yr**),
and the wedge (see §5).

### 1b. A short pays a variance tax that scales with sigma-squared

**A daily-rebalanced short earns `log(2 − e^r)`, whose expectation is approximately
`−mu − sigma^2`.** Found independently from two directions:

- [D251](decisions/D251-the-cross-sectional-dollar-neutral-pre-screen.md) measured the drag at
  **6.2 to 14.9 points/yr** on ETFs, and it is why **five cells cleared as a spread table and
  zero cleared as a book**. *A spread table is stated in a coordinate system where shorting is
  free of variance drag.*
- [D253](decisions/D253-the-book-short-sides-on-crypto.md) tested the formula against a
  measurement:

| | |
|---|---:|
| crypto universe vol 77.6% → `sigma^2` | 0.602 |
| geometric drift `mu` | −4.17% |
| **predicted** `−mu − sigma^2` | **−56.05%** |
| **measured** `SHORT_ALL` | **−58.90%** |

**Within 2.85 points.** The same convexity with the sign reversed is why a daily-rebalanced
equal-weight basket returned **+32.55%** while the median coin returned **−9.12%** — variance is
a tax on the short side and a rebalancing subsidy on the long side. **The two sides of a universe
are not mirror images.**

### 1c. Consequences

- **A short is not survivable at full notional on a high-volatility universe.** D253's guard
  (written for D238) fired on **BTG-USD +215.1%, 2025-06-13**, an equity multiple of **−1.15**.
  Maximum survivable per-name notional: **0.46x**.
- **Gap-through is a base rate, not a tail story.** **62.9% of crypto names** produced at least
  one bar above +50%, against **0% of ETFs**.

## 2. The instrument decides more than the signal

**The hypothesis** (proposed by the principal, 2026-08-28): an ETF is a weighted average, so
diversification removes idiosyncratic variance by construction; what remains is the common
factor, and the common factor is exactly what carries the risk premium. **Diversification removes
the component where an edge could live and leaves the component you are paid to bear.**

### Confirmed for shorts

[D253](decisions/D253-the-book-short-sides-on-crypto.md): S1's short mirror has **real timing
skill on crypto** — 98.7th percentile of its matched-count rotation null — where the identical
rule has none on ETFs. The buy-the-dip premium reverses sign between the universes:

| forward 21-bar return of names that have fallen | ETFs | crypto |
|---|---:|---:|
| low idiosyncratic share | **+39.77%** | **−50.57%** |
| high idiosyncratic share | +5.33% | −61.43% |

### Falsified for breakouts

[D254](decisions/D254-the-wedge-breakout-on-crypto.md): down-breaks outperform up-breaks in
**both** universes — ETF spread −6.96 to −10.05, crypto −20.22 to −62.50. **Diversification
cancelling asset-specific continuation is not what killed the ETF wedge.**

### The refinement that matters

**The operative variable is between-universe, not within-universe.** Idiosyncratic share does
**not** predict shortability inside a universe — `corr = −0.195` (n.s.) on 46 equity ETFs,
`−0.006` on 62 crypto names. What matters is whether **a risk premium attaches to the thing that
fell**.

**And 1−R² does not measure idiosyncratic risk for an ETF.** GDX at 0.85 is gold-beta, not company
risk. **There is no such thing as a high-idiosyncratic ETF** — every ETF is *some* factor; the only
question is which.

### The two effects oppose each other

**Idiosyncratic variance is where the short edge lives, and it is also what makes a short bleed
at `sigma^2`.** Crypto has enough of the second to swamp the first by an order of magnitude. **A
single-name equity universe sits between the two extremes**, which is what makes it the deciding
test rather than an extension.

## 3. Beating a null is not having a strategy

Two results on opposite sides of one lesson, from the same day:

- [D253](decisions/D253-the-book-short-sides-on-crypto.md): **S1_short cleared hurdle H at the
  98.7th percentile on both legs and returned −10.12%/yr.**
- [D254](decisions/D254-the-wedge-breakout-on-crypto.md): **both long cells made money and
  neither beat its null** — the +32.55% pooled buy-and-hold was doing the work.

**Hurdle H is a SKILL test. It cannot see structural drag, and it cannot distinguish return from
exposure.** D254 therefore introduced **hurdle V**: a cell is not a success unless it also posts a
**positive net CAGR** after fees, financing and borrow. **H without V is a measurement, not a
result.**

---

## 4. Breadth is the recurring binding constraint, and headcount cannot fix it

**Effective independent instruments saturate at `1/rho` regardless of `n`:**

| universe | n | rho | effective |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| the 57 ETFs | 57 | 0.47 | **2.2** |
| the wide ETF universe | 486 | 0.48 | **2.1** |
| US single names | ~3,000 | 0.25 | **~4** |
| single names, factor removed | ~3,000 | 0.02 | **~50** |

**Universe size buys almost nothing on its own — correlation is the ceiling.** Confirmed
empirically in [BOOK.md](BOOK.md): going from 57 to 486 ETFs *lowered* effective breadth.
D251 measured the factor-removal gain directly: the eigenvalue participation ratio rises from
**3.61 raw to 11.55 on market-neutral residuals**.

**Two consequences the programme had to absorb:**

- **Hurdle E has failed in every study of the last two sessions.** The wedge gives a minimum of
  **5** entries/symbol on 57 ETFs over 12.8 years and **3** on crypto. **Entries scale with span,
  not universe size.**
- **Instrument holdouts are much weaker evidence than their headcount suggests.** S1's 385-ticker
  ETF holdout contains roughly **two** independent tests. Headcount is not sample size.

## 5. Exit overlays have a measured ceiling on this book

[D255](decisions/D255-stops-and-targets-on-the-book.md) did not merely fail to clear a bar; it
**measured the maximum any exit rule of this form could achieve**:

> **The single best level out of 600, chosen with perfect hindsight, improves S1 by +0.017
> Sharpe** — because **97.2% of its trades never travel far enough to be cut.**

**Reachability is the reason**, and it is a property of the book rather than of the overlay:

| arm | trades | **median max gain** | median max loss | reach +20% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| S1 | 2,374 | **+2.37%** | −1.55% | **2.8%** |
| S2 | 393 | +5.89% | −3.19% | 9.7% |

**The asymmetry is real and reproduces on two independent controls:** take-profits help, stops
hurt. A stop on a rule that buys dips cuts the signal — D236's mechanism, now measured from the
universe side at **+89.74%** forward after a −20% five-bar move.

**One row is not dead:** **61.8% of all stop levels beat S2's base** (best +0.121), so a stop
generically helps the trend arm — but **no particular level is special**, so the effect is *having
a stop*, not *having a 10% stop*.

---

## 6. Measured effects are frequently one era

**Three instances in a single day**, which is why era-splitting is now reflexive:

- [D250](decisions/D250-the-overnight-gap-pre-screen.md): the gap tail's sign **inverts** without
  2020 — `z <= -3.0` goes from −37.52% to **+13.54%**.
- **The overnight/intraday decomposition itself.** [D247](decisions/D247-the-short-side-at-fifteen-minutes.md)
  reported +8.59% overnight against −0.36% intraday, and the programme quoted it as structural.
  **Split by era it does not hold:**

  | | intraday drift |
  |---|---:|
  | full sample | −0.33% |
  | excluding 2020 | **+1.44%** |
  | **2021 onward** | **+3.05%** |

  **A book deployed today faces a positive intraday headwind, not a negative one.** The gap is
  stable across boundary placements (6.8–8.0% from 10:00 onward), so this is not the microstructure
  artifact Lachance (2021) describes — it is era dependence.
- Rapach et al.'s aggregate short-interest timing, per the literature review: the entire result
  disappears without 2008.

## 7. The objective is Sharpe, not return

From the prop-firm review (`research/shorts/05-prop-firm-reality.md`):

- **Netting $50,000/yr requires a Sharpe near 2.14**, not the 0.92 this book runs at. Modelled as
  ABM against a trailing barrier, 20 funded accounts at S=0.9 yield **~$24,200 after tax** — half
  the target — with the correlated book dying every ~3.85 years.
- **Every major futures prop firm auto-liquidates at the close.** No plan permits an overnight
  hold, which makes **both existing arms structurally unportable**.
- **Automation is banned at the funded stage** by Apex and Take Profit Trader; only Topstep and
  MyFundedFutures permit it.
- Own capital needs ~**$1.03m** unlevered, or ~**$350k** at 3x.

**Return = Sharpe x volatility x leverage, and leverage is available from both routes — but only
above a Sharpe that survives the drawdown constraint.** The research problem is therefore
**roughly doubling Sharpe**, which re-values a near-zero-correlation arm above a high-return one.

## 8. What is closed

**Do not revisit without a new mechanism, not merely a new parameter:**

| | closed by |
|---|---|
| directional shorts on liquid ETFs | D238, D240, D247, D248, D249 — structural, see §1 and §2 |
| the wedge breakout | D249, D254 — three distinct claims, two universes |
| stops and targets on this book | D235, D236, D240, D249, **D255** — ceiling measured |
| cross-sectional dollar-neutral on ETFs | D251 — nothing cleared stage 1 |
| structural-decay instruments (VXX, leveraged pairs, contango) | `research/shorts/02` — best case +2.35%/yr with instrument-termination risk |
| classic short anomalies for liquid names | `research/shorts/01` — the premium is absent, not merely expensive, in value-weighted liquid names |
| the Impulse MACD at intraday frequencies | D247, D248 — four constructions |
| the volume regime gate | D226 — the spike moved between asset classes; a fitted parameter |

## 9. What is live

**One test, and it decides two questions at once:** the single-name equity fixture
(`us_shorts_daily_raw.csv.gz`, 231 names, **32.5% dead**, ragged, split-adjusted, per-symbol
pre-live screen).

1. **The short hypothesis** — enough idiosyncratic variance to carry an edge, without crypto's
   `sigma^2` swamping it and its 62.9% gap-through rate.
2. **Take-profit reachability** — the exact quantity that closed D255, and the one that should
   differ most between a basket and a single name.

**Caveat:** 231 names gives effective breadth near 4, not 50. Enough for a real test, not enough
for a decile sort.
