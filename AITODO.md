# AI TODO

Claude's current working task list for this project — not a roadmap (that's
[`DEVELOPMENT_TIMETABLE.md`](DEVELOPMENT_TIMETABLE.md)) and not a decision log (that's
[`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/README.md)). Kept short: only what's immediately in front of
us. Update this at the start/end of each working session — stale entries here are worse than
none.

## Now

- [x] Set up the full doc suite (ADR records, RULES.md, CHANGELOG.md, this file, README.md)
- [x] Initialize local git repo + `.gitignore`
- [x] Write `PHILOSOPHY.md`, wired into README.md and RULES.md
- [x] Scaffold the Python project (`uv`, src-layout, pytest + hypothesis — logged as D50)
- [x] **Step 1 of `VERIFICATION_SCHEME.md` — gate passed.** TrialRegistry (D20), stop-gap
      fill fix (D10), calendar-day carry accrual (D33, + day-count convention D51). 20/20
      tests green: 7 golden (stop fills), 4 golden + 1 property (carry accrual), 8 unit
      (registry).
- [x] Commit Step 1 code + D50/D51 decision records
- [x] **Step 2 of `VERIFICATION_SCHEME.md` — gate passed.** Declarative config + factories
      (D35), config schema convention logged as D52. 35/35 tests green (15 new).
- [x] **Phase A milestone reached: the reproducibility loop closes** — a trial can be
      logged, reloaded, and re-run identically (`test_reproducibility_loop.py`).
- [ ] Commit Step 2 code + D52 decision record

## Next (queued, not started)

- [ ] Phase B kickoff: Step 3 — CostStack + Instrument + signal→target→order pipeline
      (D1, D2, D12, D27), timeboxed to ~2 weeks per R2. This is "the whale" — the
      slip rule (split D27 out if the refactor regression gate isn't passing by end of
      week 5) applies once this starts.
- [ ] Before starting Step 3: re-read D1/D2/D12/D27 together, since D52's config-schema
      convention was chosen anticipating CostStack bricks reusing it — confirm that
      still fits once the real bricks are designed, don't just assume.

## Watch list (not urgent, don't forget)

- R2: CostStack + Instrument refactor (Phase B) is timeboxed to ~2 weeks once it starts — if the
  refactor regression gate isn't passing by end of week 5, split D27 out per the slip rule.
- R1: no framework scope creep beyond the current build order until the XLE/XOP walk-forward
  produces a first real number (Phase C milestone, week ~8, kill criterion at week 10).

## Log

- **2026-07-13** — Doc suite created (D1–D49 migrated to `docs/decisions/`, R1–R4 moved to
  `docs/RULES.md` + R5 added, `CHANGELOG.md`/`README.md`/`AITODO.md` created, git initialized).
  Old `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` and `MASTER_PROJECT_DOC.md` marked as frozen historical snapshots.
  Implementation not yet started.
- **2026-07-13** — `PHILOSOPHY.md` added: five pillars (structural trust, honesty over
  comfort, anti-self-deception, composability, scope discipline) extracted from the pattern
  across the existing 49 decisions, not written fresh. Sits above `docs/RULES.md` and
  `docs/decisions/` as the thing new decisions get checked against. Requested explicitly
  before starting Step 1, so it's settled before any code exists.
- **2026-07-13** — Step 1 implemented and gate passed. Scaffolded with `uv` (src-layout,
  pytest + hypothesis — D50). Built `backtest_framework.simulator.fills.stop_fill_price`
  (D10: gap-through-stop fills at the bar open) and
  `backtest_framework.simulator.carry.accrue_carry*` (D33: calendar-day accrual; day-count
  convention ACT/365 logged separately as D51 since D33 never specified one). Built
  `backtest_framework.registry.trial_registry.TrialRegistry` (D20: SQLite-backed,
  append-only via primary key, deterministic canonical-JSON hash over
  config+snapshot_id+seed). 20 tests, all green — golden-master hand-arithmetic files sit
  next to their test files per D39. No portfolio/broker/engine built yet; Step 1 stayed
  deliberately narrow (pure functions + registry), full integration is Step 3's job.
- **2026-07-13** — Step 2 implemented and gate passed. Built a generic
  `FactoryRegistry`/`ConfigError` pair (`backtest_framework.config.factory`) plus a
  `SimConfig` validator (`config.sim_config`) and two demonstration model configs,
  `CarryModel`/`FillModel`, that wrap Step 1's `accrue_carry_between_bars` and
  `stop_fill_price` behind the `{"type": ..., ...params}` schema — logged as D52.
  Deliberately did *not* pull Step 3's CostStack/Instrument refactor forward just because
  the verification scheme's Step 2 test language ("mini-backtest", "equity curves")
  implied richer objects than currently exist; built the mechanism generically instead and
  proved it against what's real. All four Step 2 gates pass, including the full
  reproducibility loop (config → hash → registry → reload → re-run), which is also the
  Phase A milestone. 35 tests total, all green.
